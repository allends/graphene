I am creating an offline, open source version of the Graphite CLI.

The Graphite CLI is a tool that allows you to manage your GitHub branches and pull requests.
The Graphite CLI is a command line application that uses the GitHub API to manage your branches and pull requests.

The features that I want to focus on are:
- Interactive branch checkout
- Creating branches based off of other branches
- Rebasing branches when there is a change on an upstream branch
- Pushing branches to GitHub
- Pulling branches from GitHub
- Listing branches
- Creating pull requests

Tools that I will use:
- SQLite for the database
- Commander.js for the command line interface
- Octokit for the GitHub API
- Inquirer.js for the interactive prompts
- Chalk for the colored output
